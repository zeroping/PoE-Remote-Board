These libraries came from unknown sources. They're included ehre so that you can at least open the schematic and board layout, but they may fall under someone else's license. 

If you are the owner of one of these, please email me to let me know what license it's under, and tell me to take it down if needed.

Below are the notes of what I know about the libs:

microchip-enc28j60 appears to be a converted eagle library.
transistor appears to be a converted eagle library.
